# TransportationProblem

This repository hosts a C# console application aimed at solving the transportation problem, a classic optimization challenge in operations research. The project utilizes a combination of the North-West Corner Rule for generating an initial feasible solution, and the Potential Method for refining this solution to minimize transportation costs between multiple suppliers and consumers.

# Key Features

**Interactive Input:** Users directly input supply, demand, and cost data through console prompts.

**Detailed Output:** Visual representation of solutions in the console for easy analysis.

**Robust Error Handling:** Incorporates custom exceptions for managing input errors.
# Usage:

Compile and run the **TransportProblem** class, input the required data as prompted, and view the step-by-step solution process from initial feasible setup to optimized cost distribution.

# Contribute:
